              My name is Artur Agalarian, and currently a full-time student at
              Portland State University. As I'm finishing my third year of
              undergraduate Computer Science course, I'm planning to dive into
              hands-on learning on network cybersecurity tools, and participate
              in CTF competitions.

                Generally I would say that I didn't get to specialize in
                anything in particular, but there were many things that I've
                poked at and tried out! Such examples could be:

                      Stellnull Jetball is an arcade styled gamed created within
                      a single month for the local August GameJam showcase. I
                      was the part of the 4-member group working on the project.
                      Core attraction of the game revolved around the player's
                      movement and ghost mechanics, giving an interesting spin
                      to the standard sports formula.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It's a futuristic 2D soccer game where the player is faced
                      with the AI opponent; the player must score higher than
                      the opponent in order to win the match. The game was made
                      using
                      <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Game Engine</a>
                      in about a month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The player was able to either move left-and-right on the
                      surface, or perform a perpendicular jump; jumping allowed
                      you to intercept the ball, but left you unable to move.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once the first round was finished, the ghost mechanic was
                      activated, spawning the copies of both players that will
                      interact with the match during the round. Ghosts are
                      intangible to the actual players, but tangible to the
                      ball. This mecanic allowed ghosts to create an interesting
                      spin on the formula. Ghosts will reinact the movement of
                      the previous round's player, effectively being a replay of
                      the previous round while interacting with the current
                      match by intercepting with the ball.

                      I was one of the programmers on the team. My primary
                      objective was to model the behavior of the AI enemies in
                      the game, as well as refactor the code to make developer
                      friendly, and fix bugs. The team was great and very
                      organized due to the GameJam month limit, giving me an
                      opportunity to be a part of a development team. This also
                      gave me experience in developing small games with Godot
                      Game Engine, and I must mention that Godot is very
                      intuitive and versitile.

                      The "Playverse" project was created as an assignment for
                      CS314 Software Engineering class, being tasked to create
                      messaging website/app in the teams of two people in a span
                      of a month. The app was originally intended to target the
                      gaming communities, but for now deployed as a general
                      prototype.

                      A simple messaging website has the set of essential tools
                      for communication between the users. It has the tools for
                      authentication, authorization, socket communication, and
                      more.

                      Students were split into the teams of two, where one
                      person was tasked with building the frontend while the
                      other with building the backend for the application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I chose to build the backend of our messaging app, while
                      my teammate was busy with the frontend. In order to build
                      the website, we've been using the set of app building
                      tools called
                      <a
                        href="https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/mern-stack"

                      the provided link.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As a part of building process, we implemented the testing
                      mechanisms to ensure our product was functional throughout
                      the creation process. Since we used technologies such as
                      React and Node.js (as it is a part of MERN stack discussed
                      earlier), we've decided to pick
                      <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest framework</a> to createa
                      and run our tests.

                    <p>
                      As a part of our project creation, we've created 3
                      documents that gave us an experience of writing the
