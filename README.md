## Idea of the website

This is my personal website deployed through Github Gages. Click here to learn more about GitHub pages: `https://pages.github.com/`

The website presents you overall information about my professional sphere and experience. I'm highlighting some projects I've been working on, different fields I showed interest in, tools I have been using throughout my years, and my resume.

There's a section for my contact information if you want to reach me.

## Webstie replication

If you want to replicate the website for any reason, all you require are the source files and up-to-date versions of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as Bootstrap. I'm using bootstrap version 5.0.2 which can be obvserved in HTML source code.
